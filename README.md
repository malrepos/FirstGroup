# Inflation: Past, Present and Future

Our project attempts to compare the rising, and persistent inflation of the 1970's with the current inflationary trend. We explore economic data, such as government spending, gold, and housing, that potentially provide some indicators of inflation for the current decade.

## Key Terms

### Inflation

From wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation):

> "In economics, inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services in an economy. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money."

### CPI

From wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index):

> "A consumer price index (CPI) is a price index, the price of a weighted average market basket of consumer goods and services purchased by households. Changes in measured CPI track changes in prices over time."

### Correlation

From wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation):

> "In statistics, correlation or dependence is any statistical relationship, whether causal or not, between two random variables or bivariate data. Although in the broadest sense, "correlation" may indicate any type of association, in statistics it normally refers to the degree to which a pair of variables are linearly related. "

### Lead Indicator

From forbes.com(https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2020/10/23/whats-the-difference-between-lagging-and-leading-indicator/?sh=446cbcec5009)

> "Leading indicators are a bit of a crystal ball and are metrics that could help you predict the future. The term leading indicators originated from economics, where it is defined as a measurable factor that shifts prior to the economy following a trend. "

### Lagging Indicator

From investopedia.com(https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laggingindicator.asp)

> "A lagging indicator is an observable or measurable factor that changes sometime after the economic, financial, or business variable with which it is correlated changes. Lagging indicators confirm trends and changes in trends."
