# Inflation: Past, Present and Future

Our project attempts to compare the rising, and persistent inflation of the 1970's with the current inflationary trend. We explore economic data, such as government spending, gold, and housing, that potentially provide some indicators of inflation for the current decade.

## Key Terms

### Inflation

From wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation):

> "In economics, inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services in an economy. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation corresponds to a reduction in the purchasing power of money."

### CPI

From wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index):

> "A consumer price index (CPI) is a price index, the price of a weighted average market basket of consumer goods and services purchased by households. Changes in measured CPI track changes in prices over time."

### Correlation

From wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation):

> "In statistics, correlation or dependence is any statistical relationship, whether causal or not, between two random variables or bivariate data. Although in the broadest sense, "correlation" may indicate any type of association, in statistics it normally refers to the degree to which a pair of variables are linearly related. "

### Lead Indicator

From forbes.com(https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2020/10/23/whats-the-difference-between-lagging-and-leading-indicator/?sh=446cbcec5009)

> "Leading indicators are a bit of a crystal ball and are metrics that could help you predict the future. The term leading indicators originated from economics, where it is defined as a measurable factor that shifts prior to the economy following a trend. "

### Lagging Indicator

From investopedia.com(https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laggingindicator.asp)

> "A lagging indicator is an observable or measurable factor that changes sometime after the economic, financial, or business variable with which it is correlated changes. Lagging indicators confirm trends and changes in trends."

### Findings

#### Will inflation continue to rise in this decade?

In the above graph of inflation from 1966 to 1979, we see a relatively flate rate during the latter half of the 1960's. From 1970's there is a marked increase which continues to increase in the first half of the decade, peaking at 15.4% in 1974. We are currently at an inflation rate identical to that of 1971. From 1071 to 1972 the inflation rate did decline slightly to 6%, and then rose sharply to 9.1 in '73, sharper still to 15.4% in '74.

What I can say is that, in terms of inflation, 2022 is in a similar position to 1971. And a slight decline in the next year may not signify a trend reversal for the decade.

#### What is the likely trend for CPI?

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) has shown an increase since 1950. However, it is only after 1970 that we see CPI making significant increases year over year. This, of course, coincides with our period of focus for high inflation.

What changed in the 1970's? "WTF happened in 1971" is an often asked question that stems from the website https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/ that origninated the question. This twitter account https://twitter.com/WTF_1971 regularly posts new data around this year as a watershed. This article https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2020/09/24/wtf-happened-in-1971 aslo sums up the data and puts the focus on the US depegging it's currency from the gold standard.

What is interesting to note is that, while inflation as a general figure of a whole economy's prices was brought under control, CPI was not. CPI has shown no decrease, displaying a constant trend of "number go up", unfortunately for most it is the very thing - cost of living - that we do not want increasing.



#### How has housing in Australia been affected by inflation?

The above goeviews plot is a little underwhelming, however, coupled with the numerical data, we can see that Hobart and Canberra experienced the highest housing inflation in the period 2020 - 2021 at 29.8 and 28.8 respectively. This is signified in the plot by the darker colors for the two cities. Sydney is not far behind with an inflation rate of 26.7%. Interestingly Melbourne was sixth in the list with "only" 20.0% inflation


#### Can we use gold prices as a lead indicator of inflation?

We can see from our gold line graph that the gold price rose sharply at the beginning of the 1970's, from around in 1970 to  $ 160 in 1975. From 1977 to 1980 we see an almost vertical line from  $ 147 to a high of  $ 614. Going into the 1980's saw a considerable drop, however never returning to it's recent low. Higher gold prices stabilized in the next decade and we have seen still further rises since.

The correlation between gold and inflation on matching years shows a negative correlation of -0.47 which is, all things considered, quite high. For just the period of 1969 to 1980, the correlation is 0.31,a positive correlation that is lower than expected but not negligible. This would suggest that as inflation rose in the 1970's so too did the price of gold, although not in tandem.

It is hard to know what to make of this data as it is not definitive and naturally changes as the period of time we are measuring for changes.


#### Final Analysis
I have been frequently reminded of the need for my text / data to support my conclusions. I don't think there is enough evidence or analysis here for me to make any kind of call on inflation trends for the next decade. I do find myself drawing on (falling into?) sentiment and my own fairly baseless opinions, and I pull back from that.

In order to make an educated prediction I would need more data, including bond prices, commodities, and to go deeper into that data in order to track likely effects and second order effects. Unfortunately time and other contraints precluded that.

What I can say with confidence is that we are on the cusp of a potential shift in inflation, towards a trending increase over the nest half decade. This would be no surprise to many. We are undergoing dramatic changes in many areas, including energy, international relations, globalisation and culture. I believe the next six to twelve months will show stond indicators for inflation for the 2020's.

There is so much noise, and so much signal right now, and it is virtually impossible to make confident predictions about much of anything.

As John Maynard Keynes famously said,

"The markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent".

My sentiment is that inflation could increase dramatically, and our comparison with the 1970's has shown some support for that, however we have not established this confidently enough to put money on it.
